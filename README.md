**Blockchain Interaction Interface**

This project provides a simple web interface to interact with a Perl script that manages a blockchain-like structure using cryptographic techniques. Users can trigger the addition of data to the blockchain through a web button.

**Features**

- Adds data to the blockchain file using a Perl script.
- Utilizes RSA signatures, nonces, and proof-of-work to ensure data integrity and security.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the blockchain script.
- Demonstrates usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripting (PHP).

**Usage**

1. Place the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files in the same directory.
2. Set up a web server environment with support for server-side scripting (e.g., Apache with PHP).
3. Modify the `script.js` file:
   - Update the fetch URL to point to the appropriate server-side script that interacts with the Perl script.
4. Implement a server-side script (e.g., PHP) to communicate with the provided Perl script:
   - Trigger the Perl script execution.
   - Capture and return the response from the Perl script (success message or error).
5. Ensure the Perl script and server-side script are properly configured and located.
6. Access the web interface by opening the `index.html` file through a web browser.
7. Click the "Add Data to Blockchain" button to interact with the Perl script and add data to the blockchain.

**Notes**

- The provided Perl script utilizes various cryptographic modules for data security and integrity.
- Ensure proper setup of the server environment and server-side scripting to enable interaction with the Perl script.
- The JavaScript code assumes the availability of a server-side script and proper response handling.
- This project serves as a basic demonstration and should be extended for production use.

Feel free to adapt, modify, and enhance the code to suit your needs.
