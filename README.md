Write a summary of this chat

chatgpt response:

In this chat, you provided a Perl script that utilizes various cryptographic modules to interact with a blockchain-like structure. The script generates RSA key pairs, creates data blocks with signatures and nonces, performs proof-of-work, and appends validated data to a file. You then requested assistance in creating an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interface to interact with the Perl script. I provided you with sample code for these files, enabling users to trigger data addition to the blockchain via a button click. Please note that the provided JavaScript code assumes the presence of a server-side script to interface with the Perl code.
